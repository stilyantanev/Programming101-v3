`fill_tetrahedron(num)` takes one argument that is the edge length of a Regular tetrahedron in centimeters. It should return the amount of water that can be filled in the tetrahedron. Return that amount in liters.

You can use any language you know.

Examples:
```
>>> fill_tetrahedron(100)
117.85
```
You can fill Regular tetrahedron with edge of 100 cm with 117.85 liters of water.
