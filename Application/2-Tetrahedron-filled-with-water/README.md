#Tetrahedron filled with water.
You have to implement a function with the following signature: `tetrahedron_filled(tetrahedrons, water)`.
- The argument tetrahedrons is list of integers. Each is edge length of a Regular tetrahedron
- The argument water is an integer. It is the amount of water that we have in liters.
- The function should return a integer.

`tetrahedron_filled(tetrahedrons, water)`.It should return the maximum number of tetrahedrons that can be field with hater liters of water.

You can use any language you know.
You can use the previous function.

Examples:
```
>>> tetrahedron_filled([100, 20, 30], 10)
2
```

You can fill only 2 of this Regular tetrahedrons with 10 liters of water. First you are going to fill the second than the third tetrahedron. With the total amount of ~ 4 liters. You won't have water to fill the first tetrahedron.
